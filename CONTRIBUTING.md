Contributing
============
Contributions of any kind (bug fixes, new features...) are welcome!
This is a development tool and as such it may not be perfect and may be lacking in some areas.

Certain future functionalities are marked with TODO comments throughout the code.
This however does not mean they will be given priority or ever be done.


Reporting bugs
--------------
- Ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under
[Issues][githubissues].

- If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem,
[open a new one][githubnewissue]. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**,
as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case**
demonstrating the expected behaviour that is not occurring.


Writing a patch
---------------
- Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

- Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution.
Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

- Before submitting a merge request please run a comprehensive code quality analysis

- When you feel that a certain code quality rule is not applicable, make sure to limit your
warning suppression is as strict as possible to not supress other rules that should apply.

- Please ensure your merge request aligns to existing coding style and naming conventions for consistency.


Cosmetic changes
----------------
- Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability,
functionality, or testability will generally not be accepted.


New features
------------

- Suggest your change(s) to our [mailing list][mailinglist] before writing code.
This will allow us to ensure we do not have a race condition with other contributors.

- Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change.
GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.


Questions
---------

- Email any question to our [mailing list][mailinglist].
We will endeavour to answer, but please excuse us if we don't.
The support for this project is dependent on the availability of spare time for our staff.


Documentation
-------------

- DTail's code is documented to a large extent and additional usage documentation is provided
in this project's [doc/](doc/) directory.

- If you feel that certain areas are lacking and wish to contribute please follow the
**writing a patch** instructions.
